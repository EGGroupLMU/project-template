  abstract = {Addressing the largely overlooked area of illegal action in geography, this study draws upon an institutional framework to examine how actors of legitimate institutions admit to their actions in the face of conflicting regulations. In recreational fishing, the practice of voluntary `catch and release' (C\&R) of fish collides with official regulations in most German federal states. Yet, despite the prohibition by law and the threat of criminal conviction, this is widely legitimized as a conservation practice. Grounded on extensive social media research and interpretive content analysis I qualitatively extract the underlying social practices that unite voluntary C\&R anglers into a cohesive group. Building on these findings, I propose the strategy of institutional signaling as a means of encoding compliance with common expectations while avoiding explicit acknowledgment of unlawful behavior. In this way, the study sheds light on a relatively unexplored facet of our social fabric, where the realms of legitimacy and illegality intersect.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the global controversy surrounding the innovation of cryptocurrencies, developing an analytical framework to assess the empirical structure of arguments. By unpacking an argumentation analysis of a comprehensive set of scholarly, media, and industry publications, we identify six key dimensions of disagreement, comprising 42 distinct arguments. These dimensions include the raison d'{\textasciicircum}etre, environmental impact, social inclusion, susceptibility to illegal activities, economic impact, and potential for decentralization and democratization. Our findings reveal entrenched positions supported by robust scholarly research and empirical evidence. Cryptocurrencies represent a controversial innovation, for which global resolution remains elusive. While the controversy may appear unbounded, we plead for a geographical approach, emphasizing that localized institutional contexts are crucial for exploring potential trajectories of the controversy. Finally, our analysis illustrates the potential of argumentation analysis to properly disentangle complex societal disagreements, and it therefore promises to enrich the methodological pluralism in economic geography.},

  abstract = {The continued emphasis on innovation in urban and clustered settings has led many geographers to conceive peripheries as laggard and non-innovative. After reconstructing discussions of the periphery in the context of the geography of firmlevel innovation, we argue that normative connotations should be stripped away, and that `periphery' and `center' are better understood as positions in a field. We draw upon concepts current in network theory and propose a relational definition of periphery as a distant, dispersed and disconnected position relative to a core within a field. A key distinction is made between the position of an actor in geographical space (location) and the position of an actor in a social network of relations. Combining geographic and network dimensions of an actor's position, our aim in this article is to propose a dual core-periphery framework which provides the vocabulary and concepts to empirically scrutinize the role of periphery in innovation processes. Although we focus on the geography of innovation, this framework can be applied more broadly to discussions of peripherality.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes the structure of socially embedded exchange under uncertainty in the context of a community currency system in Germany. We discuss three relational and path-dependent mechanisms---experience-based trust, networked reputation and public reputation---which serve as navigation practices to mitigate uncertainty. We furthermore associate these mechanisms with observable structures of exchange, namely repeated transactions and reciprocity, transitivity and provider activity, and discuss differences in product-inherent uncertainty as a source of variation in network structure. Based on original observations of more than 4000 transactions over a period of 8\,years, we use relational event models to demonstrate that the history of transactions exhibits structure consistent with the three hypothesized mechanisms, with some variation across different types of transactions. This variation is partly in line with differences in product-inherent uncertainty, but we also discuss alternative sources of variation related to organizational and institutional conditions of the exchange system.},

  abstract = {Driven by the ubiquity of plastic waste and its danger to environment and health, there have been increased efforts in the development of plastic recycling technologies. However, plastic recycling is a heterogeneous technological field which involves different application contexts, process stages, and technological approaches. In this paper, we study the structure of interrelated technological development of different recycling technologies. Utilizing patent citation data on more than 100,000 patents and focusing on textile applications, separation techniques, and biological recycling as example subdomains, we use patent-based main path analysis to delineate the co-evolution of technological trajectories. We report two main findings: First, comparative analysis of the three domains shows that differences in main path cohesion and homogeneity coincide with differences in development maturity and organizational concentration of patenting activity. Second, integrated analysis of the three domains shows a strong degree of historical dependence between textile recycling and separation techniques while biological recycling has so far mostly developed in its own niche.},

More precisely, we are interested in how these factors relate to the type of governance actors and the governance scale at which their partners operate. We concentrate on 195 NGOs based in twenty-one Latin American countries. Our hypotheses postulate that the perceived benefits are shaped by both country-level factors and NGO-specific factors. Our network analysis reveals that the NGOs have formed networks with different types of organizations, which are located at different scales of the polycentric governance system. The findings of our regression models show that these factors especially explain the governance scale at which the NGOs' partners operate. The explanatory power of the models is lower for the types of actors with which the NGOs form partnerships, indicating the need for further theorizing.},

  abstract = {The Unified Patent Court (UPC) will be the pillar of a unified European patent enforcement system. Crucial to its success will be the harmonization of geographical variation in national jurisdictions. Germany offers a unique opportunity to explore such harmonization, as plaintiffs can choose between twelve regional courts to file a patent suit, resulting in different patent court practices within the same jurisdiction. Adopting a legal geography perspective, we examine the appellate process as a mechanism that reconciles regional variation in court practices. Based on more than 100 decisions from 34 contentious litigations that went through all instances up to the Federal Court of Justice between 2005 and 2019, we find that decision reversals, case citations and guiding principles are important tools to improve error correction and judicial consistency within an IP system. We see these instruments as crucial for national harmonization also in the upcoming European framework.},
